# Part 2: Advanced Prematurity Classification Using Structural Connectivity

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for Part 2 of the "Prematurity-Classification-Using-Structural-Connectivity" series, following up on the initial installment. This section focuses on utilizing advanced classifiers to predict preterm birth from structural connectivity matrices, with specific emphasis on addressing overfitting, class imbalance, and feature overlap through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset provided includes:
- `matrices_train.p`: Connectivity matrices for the training set.
- `subject_info_train.csv`: Contains age at scan and prematurity status for the training set.
- `matrices_test.p`: Connectivity matrices for the test set.
- `subject_info_test.csv`: Contains age at scan and prematurity status for the test set.
- `label_names.csv`: Names of the 90 brain regions.
